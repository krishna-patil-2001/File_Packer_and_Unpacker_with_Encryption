# File_Packer_and_Unpacker_with_Encryption

Technology: Java programming

This project  is a Java-based  file utility tool  that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them  back with all metadata preserved.
To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt & extract the data.
the project also features a Graphical User Intetrface (GUI) for user friendly interaction.

Key Features

* File Packing
  - Combines multipple regular files into a single archive file.
  - stores metadata (file name, size, timestamps) along with file content.

* File Unpacking
  - Extracts individual files from the packed archive.
  - Restores all original metadata and file structure.

* Data Security
  - Built in Encryption & Decryption to protect packed files.

* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - User-friendly GUI built in Java (Swing).
  - Provides simple options for selecting files, encrypting, packing & unpacking.

* Cross-platform
  - Runs Seamlessly on any system with a java Runtime Environment (JRE).

* Learning Outcomes
  - Practicle experience with Java I/O Streams and File Handling APIs.
  - Implementation of metadata management during file operations.
  - Strong understanding of encryption/decryption techniques in java.
  - Hands-on experience with GUI developemnt (Swing).
  - Insight into archiving and compression utilities (similar to ZIP/TAR).
